    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pasta salad is a versatile, refreshing dish perfect for picnics, potlucks,
      or light meals. It combines cooked pasta (such as fusilli, penne, or
      farfalle) with a variety of fresh vegetables, herbs, and sometimes
      proteins like chicken, tuna, or cheese, all tossed in a flavorful dressing
      — typically olive oil‑based with lemon juice, vinegar, or yogurt. The key
      is using cold or room‑temperature pasta and letting the salad marinate
      briefly to allow the flavors to meld, resulting in a satisfying,
      make‑ahead side or main course that’s both colorful and easy to customize.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Pasta</li>
      <li>Fresh vegetables</li>
      <li>Cheese</li>
      <li>Dressing</li>
      <li>Herbs and extras</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the pasta.</strong> Boil pasta (penne, fusilli, or
        farfalle) in salted water until al dente. Drain, rinse with cold water
        to stop cooking, and let cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the vegetables and other ingredients.</strong> Chop
        fresh veggies (e.g., cherry tomatoes, cucumber, bell pepper, red onion).
        If using, dice cheese (mozzarella, feta) and any proteins (chicken,
        tuna). Tear or chop herbs (basil, parsley) if adding.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make the dressing and assemble.</strong> In a small bowl, whisk
        together olive oil, lemon juice or vinegar, salt, and pepper. In a large
        mixing bowl, combine cooled pasta, vegetables, cheese, and proteins.
        Pour dressing over and toss gently to combine. Let the salad rest for
        5–10 minutes before serving to allow flavours to meld.
