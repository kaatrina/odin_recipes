    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pizza is a quintessential Italian dish that has become a global favourite.
      It typically consists of a round, thin yeast‑based dough topped with
      tomato sauce, melted cheese (usually mozzarella), and a wide variety of
      ingredients such as vegetables, meats, or seafood. The dough is
      hand‑stretched, baked at high heat until crisp at the edges and soft in
      the centre, and often finished with fresh herbs like basil or a drizzle of
      olive oil. Its simplicity and versatility make pizza a beloved choice for
      casual meals, gatherings, and takeaway alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beauty of pizza lies in its endless variations. From the classic
      Margherita — with just tomato, mozzarella, basil, and olive oil — to
      hearty combinations like pepperoni, mushroom, or prosciutto and arugula,
      each version offers a unique flavour profile. Regional styles add further
      diversity: Neapolitan pizza boasts a soft, airy crust; New York‑style is
      large and foldable; Chicago deep‑dish is thick and loaded with toppings.
      Whether enjoyed in a pizzeria or homemade, pizza remains a universally
      satisfying dish that brings people together.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Wheat flour</li>
      <li>Tomato sauce</li>
      <li>Mozzarella</li>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the dough and preheat the oven. </strong>Mix wheat
        flour, warm water, a pinch of salt, and a bit of olive oil to form a
        smooth dough. Knead for 5–7 minutes, then let it rest for 30 minutes.
        Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 250 ∘ C (480 ∘ F) — ideally with a pizza
        stone or baking tray inside to get extra crispy crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spread sauce and add toppings. </strong>Roll out the dough into
        a thin circle (about 30 cm in diameter). Transfer to parchment paper or
        a floured surface. Spread a thin, even layer of tomato sauce over the
        dough, leaving a small border for the crust. Sprinkle shredded
        mozzarella evenly over the sauce, then drizzle with a little olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake and serve. </strong>Carefully slide the pizza (with parchment, if using)
        onto the hot stone or tray in the oven. Bake for 8–10 minutes until the
        crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Remove from the
        oven, let cool for 2–3 minutes, then slice and serve warm.
