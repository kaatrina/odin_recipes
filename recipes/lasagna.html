    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish renowned for its rich, layered
      structure. It consists of wide, flat pasta sheets stacked in alternating
      layers with a variety of fillings. Traditional versions typically include
      a hearty meat sauce (such as ragù made with ground beef or sausage),
      creamy béchamel, and a blend of cheeses like mozzarella, ricotta, and
      Parmigiano‑Reggiano. The combination of tender pasta, savory sauce, and
      melted cheese creates a comforting, indulgent meal that’s beloved around
      the world.

    <p>
      This dish varies by region in Italy, reflecting local tastes and
      ingredients. For example, lasagna alla bolognese features ragù and
      béchamel with spinach‑infused pasta, while Neapolitan versions often
      include fried meatballs, hard‑boiled eggs, and a spicier tomato sauce. In
      modern kitchens, vegetarian variations swap meat for vegetables like
      spinach, mushrooms, or eggplant. Whether baked until bubbly and golden or
      prepared ahead and frozen for later, lasagna remains a versatile and
      crowd‑pleasing favorite for family dinners and special occasions.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>Ground meat</li>
      <li>Tomato base</li>
      <li>Béchamel sauce</li>
      <li>Cheeses</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the meat sauce (ragù). Sauté 1 finely chopped onion and 2 minced
        garlic cloves in 2 tbsp olive oil over medium heat until soft and
        translucent. Add 500 g ground beef (or a mix of beef and pork) and cook
        until browned, breaking up any lumps with a spoon. Stir in 400 g canned
        crushed tomatoes (or tomato passata), 1 tbsp tomato paste, 1 tsp dried
        basil, 1 tsp dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer uncovered for
        20–25 minutes until the sauce thickens and flavours meld; set aside to
        cool slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the béchamel sauce. In a medium saucepan, melt 50 g butter over
        medium heat. Whisk in 50 g plain flour and cook for 1–2 minutes to form
        a roux. Gradually pour in 500 ml milk, whisking constantly to prevent
        lumps. Cook, stirring, until the mixture thickens to a smooth, creamy
        consistency (like heavy cream). Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of
        ground nutmeg; remove from heat and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prep the noodles and cheese filling. If using regular lasagna noodles,
        cook them al dente according to package instructions, then drain and lay
        flat on a clean kitchen towel to prevent sticking. In a bowl, combine
        250 g ricotta cheese, 100 g grated Parmigiano‑Reggiano, and 1 egg
        (optional, for binding); mix well. Grate 200 g mozzarella for layering.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble the lasagna. Preheat the oven to 180 ∘ C (350 ∘ F). Lightly
        grease a 9 × 13‑inch (or similar) baking dish. Spread a thin layer of
        béchamel on the bottom to prevent sticking. Layer as follows: 3 noodles
        (side by side), a third of the meat sauce, a third of the béchamel, a
        third of the ricotta mixture, and a handful of mozzarella. Repeat this
        sequence 2 more times. For the top layer, place 3 noodles, spread the
        remaining béchamel over them, and sprinkle generously with the rest of
        the mozzarella and Parmigiano‑Reggiano.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake and serve. Cover the dish loosely with aluminium foil (tented to
        avoid touching the cheese) and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and
        bake uncovered for 10–15 minutes until the top is golden brown and
        bubbling. Let the lasagna rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing (this
        helps the layers set and makes for cleaner cuts). Serve warm with a side
        salad or garlic bread.
